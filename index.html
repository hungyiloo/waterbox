    <!-- Tailwind CSS is included here for convenience, as the utility-based styling
         works well with and opt-in approach. You don't need to use it if you don't
         want to. It'll be optimized away during building if you don't use it at all.
         But you can remove it explicitly as well.

         If you delete the following line, you will need to adjust theme.css to
         redefine your colors to be independent of Tailwind's palette from above -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles/tailwind.css"/>

    <!-- Feel free to remove water.css here if you have no need for lazy styling.
         In particular, if it's getting in the way of your custom styles, you can
         get rid of it and recreate what you need using tailwind or hand-rolled CSS. -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="node_modules/water.css/out/water.css"/>

    <!-- This stylesheet controls the default theme colors.
         They can be adjusted manually, and can be detached from Tailwind's colors
         if you're not using it. -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles/theme.css"/>

    <!-- Your custom stylesheets are loaded here.
         You can load more stylesheets if you need to. -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles/main.css"/>

    <!-- You can optionally put more CDN references here, like other 3rd party
         scripts and styles. But if a package exists in NPM, it's better to import
         that instead. Follow the instructions in README.md for examples on how
         to import something properly. -->
